[{"content": {"Title": "Beyond Solidity, The Language", "Subtitle": null, "Content": "## Friday, September 3, 2021\n\n###  Beyond Solidity, The Language\n\n  \nI think I was familiar enough with the syntax of the Solidity language to\nwrite any logic of smart contracts running on the Ethereum platform, what's\nnext?\n\nI would like to persuade a career in the DApps Development, I think one need\nto posses the following skills in order to play the role as professional\nBlockchain Application Developer:\n\n**Unit Testing**\n\nRegardless of whether we are practicing Test-Driven Development (TDD), we\nshould write tests for the smart contracts to ensure correctness. Writing\nTests in JavaScript from Truffle documentation is a good reference for that\nmatter. The @openzeppelin/test-helpers is a great library to simplify your\ntesting code and you can refer to Testing Time Dependent Solidity Smart\nContract Functions using OpenZeppelin Test Helpers for sample code. The\nsolidity-coverage is a good tool on test coverage report.\n\n**Security**\n\nAs smart contracts running on public networks,involved monetary transactions\nand the source code is most likely open source, it is prone to security\nattacks. Hence, security aspect is the most important aspect of smart\ncontracts after correctness. I think the best source on learn to write secured\ncodes is start from security section of the Ethereum documentation. Learn by\nplaying the Ethernaut game and reuse well-tested @openzeppelin/contracts\nlibrary and learn from well-documented million dollar mistakes. Lastly, I\nthink it is best to incorporate code analysis tool such as SmartBugs into\nautomated build pipeline. Thanks to Ender Phan, a security engineer published\nan article regarding automated pentest.\n\n**Gas (Performance) Optimization**\n\nAs execution of smart contracts in Ethereum Virtual Machine (EVM) causing\nmoney (known as gas), it is best to write optimize code for the core features\nor commonly use functionalities of the DApps. I just find out that we can\noptimize the codes beyond Solidity by using Inline Assembly. Also, I heard of\neWASM, the Ethereum client with Web Assembly runtime, which ultimately will\nreplace EVM. After some research, I think it is still in infancy stage and\ncurrently not much progress. But that doesn't stop us from getting ready and\ntrying it out with Compile Solidity to Web Assembly with SoLang or Deploying a\nWebAssembly smart contract on Oasis Ethereum.\n\n**Updated on Sep 16:** The Unit Testing, Security and Gas Optimization brought\ntogether with a build automation pipeline, please see the Solidity and Truffle\nContinuous Integration Setup with GitHub Actions to find out more.\n\n**Integration**\n\nNo application is an island including DApps, it need to integrate with\nexternal entities to function well, for example:\n\n  * Scheduler: Ethereum Alarm Clock\n  * Interplanetary File System (IPFS)\n  * The Graph API\n  * Chainlink\n\nThanks for reading.

I wrote\nthis post to capture my thoughts and experiences so far for ease of reference\nin the future.\n\n  \n\nIf you come across my previous blog post of titled \"The end is just a new\nbeginning\", you will notice that in 2013 to 2014, I am on full-stack\ndevelopment, and start from 2015 I am solely focus on back-end development. I\nintend to closing the knowledge gap of front-end development since last year\nand I chose Flutter.\n\n  \n\nBefore I start my journey for Flutter development, I would like to sum up my\nexperiences in back-end APIs development besides the common Restful APIs,\nhence I published a blog post titled \"Standard query language for your Web\nAPI, why GraphQL and OData?\". The blog post described the reasoning of using\nGraphQL API and OData API with code examples.\n\n## Flutter\n\nIn the early 2021, I created a Flutter App known as Flutter Widgets Explorer\nto learn about Flutter widgets, so that I don't need to create a new Flutter\nproject each time I want to learn about an interesting Flutter package I come\nacross in pub.dev such as the Flutter Charting library.\n\n  \n\nAs per any software project, the project is growing. It first being published\nto Google Play Store as mobile apps. then running as web apps in Fluwix.com\nand lastly Flutter Widgets Explorer mobile apps re-branded as Fluwix. Now the\nFluwix is a Flutter showcases platform on the mobile apps and web. I also\npromote Fluwix via social media channels, so far the traffic is low.\n\n  \n\nI published the following prominent blog posts relevant to Flutter besides\nthose showcases related:\n\n  * Flutter Multi-modules Support\n  * Flutter Navigation: flutter_modular or stacked?\n  * Free Code Audit For Flutter Project\n  * Flutter App Architecture: flutter_bloc or flutter_clean_architecture?\n\nThe Fluwix platform is solely front-end application at the moment, I did think\nabout adding back-end features few months ago, you can find out more from this\ngithub issue. Should I use the traditional back-end stack I know well such as\nMicronaut or Spring Boot or brand new Web3 Decentralized Applications (DApps)\nstack such as Ethereum blockchain?\n\n## Blockchain Technology\n\nAfter closing the gap, I'm back to back-end technology again namely\nBlockchain. First, I took the Udemy's Blockchain A-Z\u2122: Learn How To Build Your\nFirst Blockchain course. Thanks to the clear explanation from the instructor,\nI have good grasp of intuitions on Blockchain, Cryptocurrency and Smart\nContract.\n\n  \n\nAfter completed the course, I start exploring the Blockchain space by look\nbeyond the obvious choice for DApps development: Ethereum. Substrate, a Rust-\nbased framework to build your own blockchain by Polkadot catched my interest.\nIn a short time, I find out that to get into Substrate, the prerequisites are\nknowledge of Rust programming language and Web Assembly. I took the Udemy's\nThe Rust Programming Language course and completed the tutorial in Rust and\nWebAssembly book, then the Build a Bitcoin-like Blockchain with Substrate -\nBeginner Friendly YouTube video series. After completed the video 3 of 5 of\nthe YouTube series, I realized that I jumped the gun, I'm a bit too far from\nDApps development. The Substrate framework is great for building your own\nblockhain a layer below the DApps instead of DApps itself.\n\n  \n\nAfter a big trip to Rust and Substrate, I turn my attention to the obvious\nchoice: Ethereum, I pick up the Learn Ethereum book and code along with it.\nCurrently I am at 50% of the book, so far so good. You might interested to\nfollow some of my github repositories:\n\n  * eth-erc721-marketplace: Ethereum Digital Art Marketplace (ERC-721)  \n\n  * fluwix-token: Fluwix Token (ERC-20)  \n\n  * eth-todo: Ethereum Todo Smart Contract  \n\n  * substrate-utxo-workshop: Build a Bitcoin-like Blockchain with Substrate  \n\n  * wasm-game-of-life: Conway's Game of Life with Rust and Web Assembly  \n\n  * eth-dapps-nextjs-boiletplate: Ethereum dApps Next.js Boiletplate  \n\n## Conclusion\n\nAt this juncture, I can decide to build Fluwix as DApps over the Ethereum\nblockchain network. You can expect me to write more about this topic in the\nfuture. Lastly, a lesson learned \"Sometimes it is far easier to stay with the\nobvious choice\" even the exposure to Rust and Web Assembly is not totally\nwasted.\n\n  \n\nThanks for reading. I hope you get something out of my experiences. :)\n\nPosted by Lim Chee Kin at 12:07 PM", "language": "No language found."}, "platform": "limcheekin.blogspot.com", "author_id": "d386951d-b942-46a1-8bfd-6220e47254cd", "author_full_name": "Nik Nik", "link": "https://limcheekin.blogspot.com/2021/07/closing-gap.html", "_id": "f86a876f-15d6-448b-b8dc-8ec8dbe4e568"}, {"content": {"Title": "The end is just a new beginning", "Subtitle": null, "Content": "## Friday, November 20, 2020\n\n###  The end is just a new beginning\n\nIt had been long time I didn't post anything new to my blog, oh yeah it is\nsince I joined The Hewlett-Packard Company (HP) in April, 2013. That's more\nthan 7.5 years ago, time flies. As I retrenched by DXC Technology end of last\nmonth due to re-org and join the unemployment statistics, I think it is good\ntime to review what I did in the past 7.5 years and think about where am I\nheading next.  \n  \n\nIn 2013, as I'm handful of developers in Malaysia posses skill in Grails\nFramework, HP hired me to lead the development of a project known as EPIC\nConfigurator, a configuration and management console of an integrated invoice\nprocessing system. The development team composed of architect, developers and\nUI designer from Malaysia and United States. We are using the following\ntechnology stack for source code management, development and continuous\nintegration and deployment (CI/CD):\n\n  \n\n  \nIn the EPIC Configurator team, I play the role of tech lead captures\nfunctional requirements and technical requirements from business owner and\narchitect, assigns tasks to team members and support them to deliver the\nworks. Developers in the team works as full-stack developer, they develop the\nfeatures from front-end UIs to back-end APIs and database.\n\nThere are two oversea trips for this project:  \n\n  * In January 2014, three of us from Malaysia EPIC team headed to HP office located in Texas, US for one week project meetings.\n  * In November 2014, an US colleague and I headed to Bangalore, India to conduct 2-weeks knowledge transfer sessions to India team.\n\n  \nIn 2015, the management announced HP will be split to two independent public\nlisted companies known as HP Enterprise (HPE) and HP, Inc (HPQ). I become a\nHPE employee after the split.  \n  \n\nBefore HP split, I join the China team remotely to develop a project known\nDivestiture and Acquisition (DnA). It is a dashboard portal to support the\nmanagement teams to manage the HP split and Micro Focus acquisition. We are\nusing the following technology stack for source code management, development\nand deployment:\n\n  \n\nIn the DnA team, I play the role of senior Java developer, mostly work on\nback-end APIs using Jersey, SpringFramework and MongoDB.\n\n  \n\nAt the year end of 2016, HP Enterprise management spun off Enterprise Services\nbusiness and merged it with Computer Sciences Corporation (CSC) founded the\nDXC Technology in April 2017. I become a DXC employee after the merger.  \n  \nThe born of DXC Technology is the start of Agile Process Automation (APA)\nproject, a microservices architecture for integrated process discovery,\nprocess analytic and robotic process automation such as Blueprism, UiPath and\npython script. We are using the following technology stack for source code\nmanagement, development and continuous integration and deployment (CI/CD):\n\n  \n\nAs you can see from the diagram above, APA is big undertaking, it is a huge\nproject adopted many emerging technologies. The engineering team has around 40\nmembers from US, China, Europe and Malaysia composed of UI/UX designers,\nbusiness analysts, architects, tech leads, developers, testers, scrum masters,\nproject managers, infrastructure engineer, DevOps engineer, etc.  \n\n  \n\nIn the APA team, I play the role of tech lead on leading the team to develop\nthe Analytic Console of APA which empowered the user to do data mapping,\ndefine their own tabular data and dashboard without the involvement of\ndevelopers. I also work on back-end APIs and OData APIs using Jersey, Spring\nBoot and MongoDB which deployed to Amazon Web Services and Microsoft Azure as\nDocker container.\n\n  \n\nI also worked with Europe team remotely on prototyping an intelligent voice\nagent of conversation AI domain using the following technology stacks:\n\n  \n\nFrom the writings above, you can see that I'm mostly focus on back-end\ntechnologies in the recent years. Going forward, I intend to close the loop by\npicking up a front-end technology, I chose Flutter. You should see me write\nmore about Flutter in the blog.\n\n  \n\nLastly, I'm kind of interested in online marketing skills especially those\nrelevant to subscription business.\n  \n\n\nStay safe, stay home and stay healthy! :)\n\nPosted by Lim Chee Kin at 6:01 PM", "language": "No language found."}, "platform": "limcheekin.blogspot.com", "author_id": "d386951d-b942-46a1-8bfd-6220e47254cd", "author_full_name": "Nik Nik", "link": "https://limcheekin.blogspot.com/2020/11/resurgence.html", "_id": "36a7b56d-2f3e-4611-89a5-fa56fa44e9ed"}, {"content": {"Title": "Unleashing the Power of Open Source Text Embeddings with open-text-embeddings", "Subtitle": null, "Content": "Nov 13, 2023\nIntroductionIn the dynamic landscape of Large Language Model (LLM), harnessing the capabilities of OpenAI\u2019s API has become a staple for many open source projects.

After search through the Internet, the harsh reality kick in: Most DApps in the market, sample codes and DApps-related libraries and frameworks written in JavaScript and as ReactJS components.It is not impossible to port those libraries, frameworks and components to Dart and Flutter, but it is really a big undertaking. So, I picked up ReactJS and found NextJS, the React Framework for Production. I also realized that the codes in the Learn Ethereum book is outdated, hence I took the Udemy\u2019s Master Ethereum & Solidity Programming From Scratch to have better understanding of the latest version of Solidity.To keep the long story short, the outcome is the Ethereum dApps Next.js Boiletplate.The creation of the Ethereum dApps Next.js Boiletplate is inspired by a truffle box known as truffle-next with the following improvements:TypeScript supportWalletConnect integrationBetter UI with Chakra UIJQuery HTML example (without React)Github workflow to run truffle test on every git pushIt is tested with MetaMask Chrome extension and Android. I think it is good idea to test out the dApps yourself before you continue reading further.The dApps is interacting with a Greeter smart contract that running on Rinkeby testnet, hence you need some ETH in your wallet. If you don\u2019t have any, you can request some ETH from Rinkeby Faucet.You might wonder why I still go ahead to build this boiletplate as there\u2019s great abstractions such as useDApp, web3-react, web3modal, etc. These libraries are great, but they are fall short on the following aspects:Customization. To fully customize a functionality, we need to stick to low enough abstractions such as @metamask/detect-provider, web3js and @walletconnect/web3-provider.To avoid abstraction over abstraction. For example, it would be hard to fix a bug on useDApp and web3js which has inter-dependency. I think it is far better to build the abstraction specific to DApps ourself from the base libraries.To upgrade the base libraries to the latest version without depends on the abstraction. For example, web3modal still using @walletconnect/web3-provider 1.3.x when the latest version is 1.6.x.If you are interested to look into the code and run it in your local machine, please check out the git repository hosted at https://github.com/limcheekin/eth-dapps-nextjs-boiletplate.

OData is\n> essentially SQL for the web built on top of standard protocols - HTTP, JSON\n> & ATOM XML - while leveraging the REST architecture style._\n\nIn my opinion, benefits of OData is similar to GraphQL with the following\ndifferences:  \n\n  * OData supports schema discovery by query the metadata directly with $metadata URL without introspection.\n  * OData supports ATOM XML and JSON response.\n  * OData has been adopted by a lot of technologies and companies including SAP, IBM, Salesforce, Tableau, Databoom, Progress, Red Hat and Dell especially in spreadsheet, analytics, reporting, dashboard and business intelligence applications.\n\n**Updated on Dec 30:  **You can find out more from a OData API implemented by\nme in the following blog post:\n\nhttp://limcheekin.blogspot.com/2020/12/integrating-multiple-data-sources-\nto.html  \n\n  \n\nWhat do you think?

In the person/list.gsp, specified the following code block before the\n</head> tag to import jqGrid resources:  \n\n<r:require module=\"jquery-grid-en\"/>\n\n(en is for English, the plugin support internationalization)  \n2\\. Render the JQuery Grid in the person/list.gsp using <g:jqueryGrid> tag,\nfor example:  \n\n<g:jqueryGrid for=\"com.vobject.addressbook.Person\" properties=\"title,\nfirstName, lastName, dateOfBirth, remark\" columnWidth=\"50,150,100,100,350\" />\n\n3\\. Implement the corresponding server-side operation which render data as\nJSON. In the future, server-side code writing will be eliminated as it will be\nimplemented with the help of dynamic-controller plugin like the Flexigrid\nexample.  \n  \n**Done!** You will see the person list render as JQuery Grid component in the\npicture above after you run \"grails run-app\".  \n  \nA great feature of the plugin is embedded-inline-editable grid support which\nallowed you to use the grid component in detail section of the Master-Detail\nform, for example the Communication List in the following screen:  \nThe embedded-inline-editable grid support add new row to the grid as well as\ndelete multiple selected rows. The <g:jqueryGrid> tag syntax is similar to the\nprevious one with additional type attribute, please see the sample code below:  \n<g:jqueryGrid for=\"com.vobject.addressbook.Communication\" properties=\"type,\nvalue\" type=\"embedded-inline-editable\" rowNum=\"5\" width=\"595\" />  \n  \nThe jquery-grid plugin implemented the following features:  \n\n  * Sort by column\n  * Delete selected rows\n  * Filter by column(s)\n  * Advance search\n  * Select all rows\n  * embedded-inline-editable grid with \"Add Row\" and \"Delete Row(s)\" button and jquery-validation-ui plugin integration.\n  * Show AJAX dialog and submit AJAX form (eg: Create Person and Edit Person screen)\n\n(You can see the features above in the slides I published to slideshare)  \n  \nI'd love to hear your comments!\n\nPosted by Lim Chee Kin at 4:33 PM", "language": "No language found."}, "platform": "limcheekin.blogspot.com", "author_id": "d386951d-b942-46a1-8bfd-6220e47254cd", "author_full_name": "Nik Nik", "link": "https://limcheekin.blogspot.com/2012/08/simplifying-jquery-grid-jqgrid-and.html", "_id": "2d67c2c2-8bf1-445a-a985-6707b2fa783d"}, {"content": {"Title": "Twitter Bootstrap: Multiple Columns Form Layout Examples", "Subtitle": null, "Content": "## Sunday, August 26, 2012\n\n###  Twitter Bootstrap: Multiple Columns Form Layout Examples\n\nI tried to search Twitter Bootstrap examples for multiple columns form layout.\nI was surprised that I couldn't found any, so I cook my own and publish my\nwork here.

An\nactive plugin user from US semiconductor firm saw my message and contacted me\nfor a consulting work opportunity related to the plugin, unluckily the deal\nwas not materialized. So, my priority for development of the plugin remain the\nsame.  \n  \nI would like to see the plugin keep evolving, even I can't promise I will be\nalways active in development and super responsive in community support, you\nwill see me there :). Hence, I write about the future of the Grails Activiti I\nenvisioned in this blog post. You can assume it is evolution roadmap of the\nplugin, your feedback and comments are very much appreciated.  \n  \n\n###  Business Process Management 101\n\nWhat is Business Process Management (hereafter called \"BPM\")? Let's look from\nBPM as business practice perspective, the following diagram is the BPM process\nitself:  \n  \n---  \nDiagram 1: taken from slide 12 of slides by Gregor polan  \nAs Grails Activiti plugin is built on top of Activiti BPM suite, let's look at\nthe support of Activiti BPM for the BPM processes above. In my opinion,\nActiviti BPM had great support the process modeling process with BPMN 2.0\n(Eclipse-based Activiti Designer and Web-based Activiti Modeler) and process\nexecution (Activiti Engine) with basic process management and simulation\n(Activiti Explorer).  \n  \n  \n---  \nDiagram 2: taken from slide 6 of slides by David Noble  \nLet's look at similar diagram above, the bigger text above are business\npractices, and the smaller one below are computerized systems.  \n  \n\n###  What is Missing in Activiti BPM?\n\nI break down the BPM Processes and Systems from Diagram 1 and 2 into the\nfollowing DevOps table:  \n  \n---  \nThe black color text is Business BPM and red color text is Technical BPM| | | |   \n|  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nI think Activiti BPM has great support for process modeling (Activiti\nDesigner/Modeler) and process execution (Activiti Engine), but the following\nitems have much room to improve:  \n\n  1. Process simulation: I think the user interface of Activiti Explorer is not user-friendly enough for production use. Users should able to use the deployed processes for their daily operation works after process engineer deployed the process resources (process definitions, form definitions, etc) to Activiti Engine. This will greatly shorter the process development and management cycle.\n  2. Better integration to Business Rule Engine such as Drools and OpenL Tablets\n  3. Better integration with Mule ESB or other EAI platforms\n  4. Better integration with Portal using Grails Portlets plugin. \n  5. Better monitoring and reporting features (which currently unavailable and can be implemented using HistoryService API) \n\nIn my opinion, the Grails Activiti Plugin can further expand and evolve\nquickly to deliver the improvements above by leverage the Grails Framework and\nit's richness of plugins. I think item #1 and #5 above will create greatest\nvalue to the customer business, what do you think?  \n  \n\n###  Going Forward\n\nI think most improvements above will be implemented as separate Grails\nplugins. When there is enough interest, creating a Grails Activiti\nOrganization in github is more appropriate to host Grails projects/plugins\nthat related to Grails Activiti such as Spring Security Integration plugin and\nShiro Security Integration plugin and other upcoming plugins.  \n  \nLastly, if you are interested to join the Grails Activiti Organization or your\ncompany is user of the Activiti BPM and would like to see these improvements\nimplemented, I'd love to hear from you!  \n  \n**Edited on 11 July 2012:**   Great discussion about this blog post in\nActiviti Forum.\n\nPosted by Lim Chee Kin at 1:13 PM", "language": "No language found."}, "platform": "limcheekin.blogspot.com", "author_id": "d386951d-b942-46a1-8bfd-6220e47254cd", "author_full_name": "Nik Nik", "link": "https://limcheekin.blogspot.com/2012/07/grails-activiti-evolution.html", "_id": "b98b66b7-a726-49f9-983e-7cea08aeac2d"}, {"content": {"Title": "My Blog Hits 50K Pageviews", "Subtitle": null, "Content": "## Thursday, June 28, 2012\n\n###  My Blog Hits 50K Pageviews\n\nWhen I check the stats of audience of my blog (My first time to do so), I was\nsurprise to find out that one third of the readers of my blog is from United\nStates.

It is a big leap\nforward, not a small improvement. I agreed with the tagline of Grails, \"the\nsearch is over\". Now, my thought remain the same.  \n  \nWhat is the reality out there? The reality of Java technology adoption in\nMalaysia was slow and dominated and lead by big technology companies like IBM\nand Oracle. I find out that the current status of Grails adoption in Malaysia\nis like SpringFramework in 2003. It is cool technology that adopted by\nminority. As per today, SpringFramework is mainstream technology stack that\nadopted by many Java shops after I spoken to few software managers.  \n  \nAs my base was in Malaysia and I have no plan for relocation or to work\noversea, I being forced to stick with SpringFramework and pick up Spring Roo\nrecently even I think Grails is a superior framework for web application\ndevelopment in Java platform in term of simplicity and productivity. I'd love\nhear your comments if you have different opinions.  \n  \nThe challenge is \"How do we, as lead developer, project manager or team lead\nimprove the adoption of new technology stack like Grails in Malaysia?\". What\ndo you think?  \n  \nLastly, thanks for taking your time to read this post and if you have plan to\nlaunch a web application project and free of choice for technology stack [you\nknow my preference ;-)], I'm ready to listen to your plan and happy to work\nwith you.

I've since put my email address in quite a few of\n> these. But I haven't heard back from a single one. I know launching a\n> startup takes time, but by not contacting people who are interested in your\n> startup and keeping them up to date, I'm probably going to forget all about\n> it.\n\n  \nThanks Phil, your blog post reminded me I should update registered users of\nearly access to the prototype of Form Builder via the landing page whose\ntrusted me by sending me their e-mail address. They are my valued users, they\nshould receive updates of the form builder they deserved.  \n  \nAlong the way I work out the Form Builder of ProcessCanvas.com which targeted\nto end user (If you would like to find out more about ProcessCanvas.com,\nplease see this post), I find out that some Grails developers are interested\nin Form Builder targeted to developer. Learned from my previous mistakes, I\nthink I am getting smarter, I prepare a landing page, write about it, announce\nand post updates to Grails user community to find out whether there is real\nneed for Form Builder to Grails developers.  \n  \nThe landing page launched in early March and two weeks later, 33 visitors\nsigned up for early access. The result is not too bad in my opinion, thanks to\nthose who help me to spread the news by using twitter, facebook, blog, etc. I\nlearned from Running Lean, a book written by Ash Maurya, using qualitative\napproach, _talking to people_ by conducting customer interviews such as\nproblem interview is the best way to find out whether \"Is this a problem worth\nsolving?\". So, I prepare the problem interview script and problem summary form\nby refer to guidelines in Running Lean, and send out interview invitation\nmessage to the 33 registered users. I'm ready for the interviews.  \n  \nYou guess how was the response rate? Zero! I told my friends I stuck in\n\"talking to people\" stage. What's wrong here? Is there anything wrong for\nqualitative approach suggested by Ash Maurya. Hm... Not really, it was simply\nthe fact that most developers don't like to talk to people (including myself),\nfurthermore they don't know me personally. (I still remembered the pressure I\nfelt the moment I send out the interview invitation message, I still doing it\nbecause I think I need to get over it in order to get things done). I\nunderstood that developers are busy, they preferred written communication over\nverbal communication, I should choose communication channel they preferred.  \n  \nI would like to seek your input here to ensure I create a form builder that\nmeeting your requirements. Let's me list down top 3 problem hypotheses we\nexperienced:  \n\n  1. The first problem we encountered was creating online form that look great and professional. It was challenge to many developers as it required creative skills. The design and L&F of the form getting more and more important especially it will impact end-user impression to your application.\n  2. Also, to layout form fields properly was time-consuming and required knowledge of CSS. Some developers layout form fields using HTML table, but we think CSS is better and cleaner approach.\n  3. Another problem we constantly faced was effectively creating Master-Detail Dynamic Form. It was most common type of form in application, but to create one still like black art to many developers.\n\nPlease response by answer the following questions:  \n\n  1. Do any of these problems resonate with you?\n  2. How would you rank these problems (must-have, nice-to-have, don't-need)?\n  3. Have you run into any other problems I didn't talk about?\n\n  \nToday, I signed in to my unbounce account to check how many users signed up so\nfar, the following image is the latest update:  \n  \n  \n  \n  \n  \nLastly, I included the link of this open letter in e-mail message I sent to 60\nregistered user.  \n  \nThanks for read until here.

Initially the title of this post is \"Reading\nNotes of How to Make Money in 6 Easy Steps\", this post is to capture my\nthoughts after reading the article. If you really enjoy reading as I did, it\nis great! However, what matters most is what you do after you read. I change\n\"Reading\" to \"Action\", so it become \"Action Notes of How to Make Money in 6\nEasy Steps\".  \n  \nThis is quite a long post, feel free to skip.  \n  \n**Why making money?**  \nThe question above seems no-brainer, right? Did you think of what money means\nto you? Take few minutes of your time and think deeply about it... At the end\nof this post, I will tell you what money means to most people.  \n  \n6 steps from Jason Fried:  \n\n  1. Understanding the buyer is the key to being a strong seller\n  2. In which I sell electronics, knives, and throwing stars--and learn that it's all about passion\n  3. How, and why, to charge real money for real products\n  4. There are different pathways to the same dollar\n  5. The true value of bootstrapping\n  6. A word about practicing\n\n  \nBy reading the description, the 6 steps above doesn't sound like actionable,\nlet's take one step at a time:  \n**1\\. Understanding the buyer is the key to being a strong seller  \n** Jason's lessons learned and discovery from working as tennis-shoe and\ntennis-racket salesman in his 14:  \n\n  * People's reasons for buying things often don't match up with the company's reason for selling them\n  * When you describe things in terms people don't understand, they tend not to trust you as much\n  * When customers shop for shoes, they do three things. They consider the look and style. They try them on to see if they're comfortable. And they consider the price. Endorsements by famous athletes help a lot, too. But the technology, the features, the special-testing labs--I can't remember a single customer who cared. \n  * Understanding what people really want to know--and how that differs from what you want to tell them--is a fundamental tenet of sales.\n\nMy understanding:  \n\n  * Understand what make people buy and what they look for in your product and your competitor products. Most likely it is not features. From the example above, it reminded me about the process of buying car, are they look similar?\n  * Speaking terms and language that customer understand\n  * Be a great salesman\n\n  \n**2\\. In which I sell electronics, knives, and throwing stars --and learn that\nit's all about passion  \n**Jason's lesson learned from working as reseller:  \n\n  * Sell only things you'd want to buy for yourself.\n\nMy understanding:  \n\n  * Do things that you passionate and believe.  \n\n  * Build things that you will use it yourself, a.k.a prosumer. This lesson very similar to Scratch My Own Itch, build a product to solve your own problem and dogfood the product and sell it to people that have the same problem.\n\n  \n**3\\. How, and why, to charge real money for real products  \n** Jason's lesson learned from selling his Audiofile program:  \n\n  * People are happy to pay for things that work well. Never be afraid to put a price on something. Even if there are free options.\n  * Charging for something makes you want to make it better\n\nMy understanding:  \n\n  * Make a product that so much better than free options and aimed to charge from day 1 by using Free Trial model (Try first, buy later if you like it).\n\n  \n**4\\. There are different pathways to the same dollar  \n** Jason's lesson learned from 37express:  \n\n  * Don't just charge. Try as many different pricing models as you can.\n  * Try to remove the fear and uncertainty, and people will be more willing to pay you. \n\nMy understanding:  \n\n  * Be creative and flexible about pricing of your product or service\n  * A/B testing is good way to test for different pricing models for SaaS product.\n\n  \n**5\\. The true value of bootstrapping  \n** Jason's lesson learned from bootstrapping:  \n\n  * Bootstrapping forces you to think about making money on Day One. \n\nMy understanding:  \n\n  * Monetary constraints and pressure make you work hard and think hard seriously to create a profitable business. When you have a lot of easy money, you tend to spend it easily without giving a thought.  \n\n**  \n6\\. A word about practicing**  \nHow and where to start?  \nIn this last step, Jason suggestion on practice making money: Buy and sell the\n_same thing_ over and over on Craigslist or eBay.  \n  \nKey takeaway about actions you (and I) can take:  \n\n  * Be reseller or online seller to practice your selling skills\n  * Learn about what make customer buy (your product or service)\n  * Learn about pricing models by experiments (If you sell SaaS product, pick up A/B testing to test different pricing models)\n  * Get inspired? Act now!\n\n  \nThat's all about it, thanks for reading. I'd love to hear comments from you as\nusual!  \n  \nOops! Almost forgot **Why making money?** With money, you have freedom and\nautonomy. Jason Fried make a good point in his article:  \n  \n\n> Making money is about freedom. When you owe people money, they own you--or,\n> at least, they own your schedule. As long as you remain profitable, the\n> timeline is yours to create.  \n>\n\nPosted by Lim Chee Kin at 3:59 PM", "language": "No language found."}, "platform": "limcheekin.blogspot.com", "author_id": "d386951d-b942-46a1-8bfd-6220e47254cd", "author_full_name": "Nik Nik", "link": "https://limcheekin.blogspot.com/2011/03/action-notes-of-how-to-make-money-in-6.html", "_id": "f89c5dc6-9014-4172-b67d-4549059bcbc2"}, {"content": {"Title": "Looking For Developers Working On Open Source Project In Malaysia", "Subtitle": null, "Content": "## Tuesday, March 1, 2011\n\n###  Looking For Developers Working On Open Source Project In Malaysia\n\nOn last Thursday, 24 February 2011 I sent out the following message with\nsubject \"Looking for Web Application Developer\" to 80 friends of mine who\nworking in IT industry via Facebook Messages:  \n  \nHi there,  \n  \nI am looking for Web Application Developer experienced in JQuery\n(http://jquery.com/), Subversion (SVN) and optionally server-side technology\nsuch as Grails (http://www.grails.org/), PHP, ASP or etc. to work on an open\nsource project.  \n  \nIf you are interested, I can be contacted via e-mail: myemail@mydomain.com or\nmy mobile: +6012 9999 999.  \n  \nOtherwise, If you know anyone who have the development skills mentioned above\nincluded students, junior developers, experience developers or whoever\ninvolved in web development or working in IT industry, kindly help me forward\nthis message to them.  \n  \nThank you very much.  \n  \nBest regards,  \nChee Kin  \n---  \n  \nAlso, I personally contacted 25 people out of 80 via one-to-one instant\nmessaging or phone conversation and managed to get their agreement to help me\nforward the message to their friends who working in IT industry.

I think this approach is not wrong, but a very costly approach when\nthings getting ugly. For some products, it taken too long time and need too\nmuch efforts (could be few months) even to produce a minimum viable product.\nBy the time you find out that it is not the product customer will pay to use\nit after customer validation phase, you may running out of iterations even to\npivot.  \n  \nI launched ProcessCanvas.com: A workflow builder that allow you to create\nonline workflow in minutes two months ago to see whether is there enough\ncustomers need this kind of product. I launch this product is the result of\nScratch My Own Itch, it is the first hand experience I gained over the past\ntwo years working as Business Analyst and Solution Consultant.\nProcessCanvas.com is targeted to the following customer segments:  \n\n  * IT Consultant: Use it as fast prototyping tool to create workflow application demo/prototype.\n  * Business Analyst/Business Process (ISO) Consultant: Create production workflow application for their customers.\n  * Subject Matter Experts from different industries such as Insurance (Claim Mgmt.), Medical (Case Mgmt.), Customer Service (Help Desk) and Small Business Owner to create the workflow application by themselves.\n\nSadly tell you that the result of the launch is far from satisfactory (if not\ncrying), I only received two e-mail addresses that interested in production\nlaunch of ProcessCanvas.com so far (where the e-mail sign up box is put at the\nend of process wizard by intention to ensure the user explored and used the\ntool prior to submit their e-mail address) out of 58 visits tracked by Google\nAnalytics (I think actual visits lesser than 58 if excluding my own visits).  \n  \nI had invested about 4 weeks to produce the process wizard and introductory\nscreencasts (excluded time spent to produce the Grails Activiti Plugin), since\nthen I invested another 7 weeks to produce the Form Builder plugin which just\nreleased version 0.1 on yesterday. It is foreseeable that many more weeks\nrequired in development to produce the working minimum viable product that\nsupport multi-tenancy and ability to create working workflow application.  \n  \nI give myself a _pause_ now from continuing time investment into\nProcessCanvas.com and step back to review what had I done _wrong_ so far\uff1a  \n\n  1. Invested too much time and effort to the product before knowing whether the product have market size that big enough to build a business on it. \n  2. Customers may not have the same problems that I faced. Even they faced the same problems, the problems may not pain enough until no choice they have to pay for the product to solve it. Over passionate about the solution without knowing it is real problem to paying customers is a problem by itself. \n  3. Do I know how to reach the targeted customers? Frankly speaking, I have no idea besides posting the release news and announcement to the BPM (Business Process Management) community and hanging there (Developer is poor on marketing).\n\nSome questions cracking my mind:  \n\n  1. How do I find out a product have big enough market size to build a viable business on it, with the least effort that maximize validated learning? \n  2. Is the vision too big and too broad to fit into my goal as Micropreneur?\n  3. Is the product too generic? If the answer is yes, how do I find a niche and pivot toward it?\n  4. Are these problems worth solving?\n  5. Am I targeted the right customer segments?\n\nNext, I need to perform some finding and reading to find out the corrective\nactions to make the points listed above clear enough to further support my\nnext decisions and actions. If failing is inevitable in my first web startup\nin order for me to learn, I wish to fail faster and lighter so that I can get\nover it quickly and start all over again in shorter time.  \n  \nWhat do you think?

As mentioned in the title of the post:  \n\n> **Should JQuery Form Builder Plugin support font family by language? Each\n> language has it's own font family.**\n\nThe 1.0 release of plugin is targeted to support top 2 languages of the\nInternet (more can be added later) such as English and Chinese. This decision\nis crucial as the current implementation of the plugin was support one font\nfamily for all languages, if I made up my mind to support each language has\nit's own font family, I will need to revise the structure of form settings and\nfield settings of the Plain Text field, not a minor restructuring.  \n  \n**Findings**  \nAs typography is a new topic to me, I goggle it and done some reading. I heard\nof Google Font API and  WebFont Loader, but I curious to see is there other\nalternatives. First I found Cufon, then follow by Typeface.js, both of these\nare great web fonts technology, but they are not suitable for web form use as\nboth technology using HTML5 canvas and VML. Also, Robert has good points why\nit is not for input components. Nevertheless, you may consider these\ntechnologies if you use it for presentation purpose only, you can learn more\nabout these technologies in this discussion: SIFR vs Cufon vs Typeface.js.  \n  \nMany thanks to editorial team of LogoTalks written a post related to\ntypography with title \"From TypeKit To Google Font API: The Road To Web Fonts\"\nprovides great introduction of web fonts. From the post, it was the first time\nI saw the @font-face CSS rule. After few more rounds of reading, I find out\nthat it is the way to go as it is web standard and supported by browser\nnatively (even not all browsers supported yet). Thanks to Paul done a detail\nwrite up about @font-face.  \n  \nI can find out where to get or buy web fonts from these two posts: From\nTypeKit To Google Font API: The Road To Web Fonts and Where to get web fonts.\nThe following are some sites offer free web fonts:  \n\n  * http://www.fontsquirrel.com/\n  * http://www.theleagueofmoveabletype.com/\n  * http://kernest.com/\n\n**Conclusion**  \nFrom findings above, it is clear to me that JQuery Form Builder Plugin\n**should** support font family by language especially Asian languages such as\nChinese, Japanese and Korean should use font family different from English.\nThe solution will be Google Font API and WebFont Loader (as it support custom\nprovider, web fonts can be hosted in own server). Thanks to Cedric Dugas\nwritten a great introductory post about WebFont Loader. Lastly, thanks to\nJames Brocklehurst created a Web Safe Fonts Cheat Sheet that will be very\nhelpful for later improvement of the font picker plugin.

FreeMarker support enabled by\nfreemarker plugin and freemarker-tags plugin. Special thanks to Jeff and\nDaniel creating these plugins, it will be less options for Grails view\ntechnology without their contribution. Given two options, I need to perform\nsome micro-benchmarking to find out which one is the appropriate technology\nfor given requirements.  \n  \n  \n**The Objective**  \nTo evaluate and decide which template engine (FreeMarker or GSP) to use as\nForm Template of the Grails Form Builder Plugin.  \n**  \n**  \n**The Result**  \nFreeMarker is the winner. By perform rendering 100 times for the same\ntemplate, GSP need 119,946ms and FreeMarker need approximately 1/4 of GSP,\n32,749ms (Surprise? Yes, I am surprised about the performance of FreeMarker\nover GSP in dynamic template rendering).  \n  \n****  \n**How I Did It**** **  \n**The Benchmark Case**  \nThe dynamic template was created based on the following domain class:  \n`package test_freemarker2  \n  \nclass Test1 {  \n    int prop1  \n    String prop2  \n    Date prop3  \n      \n    static constraints = { prop2 blank:false }  \n}`  \n  \nThe FreeMarker's template rendering code:`  \nnew Template(\"freemarkerTemplate\",  \n             new StringReader(freemarkerTemplateCode),  \n             freemarkerConfig.configuration)  \n            .process([test1Instance: test1Instance, flash:flash], out)`  \n  \nThe GSP's template rendering code:`  \ngroovyPagesTemplateEngine.createTemplate(gspTemplateCode,\n'gspTemplate').make([test1Instance: test1Instance]).writeTo(out)  \n`  \nAs the template code (`freemarkerTemplateCode `and` ``gspTemplateCode`) was\ntoo lengthy, I will not describe it here (You can download the complete source\ncode of the application here to run the benchmark test in your own\nenvironment).  \n  \n**The Benchmark Application**  \nI run the benchmarking tests with the following steps:  \n\n  1.

(If you\u2019re stacked supporter, it will be great if you can showcase stacked architecture using the same Number Trivia app). The good thing is the lengthy post become less lengthy.You can see the Number Trivia showcase live powered by Fluwix.com:-Ala! Too bad the Number Trivia showcase only work in mobile apps and web host other than HTTPS such as localhost. As Fluwix.com is hosted in secured site, it is facing the following error when send a get request to the numbersapi.com which is insecured:Kindly let\u2019s me know if you found a solution for the error above.You can find out details of the Number Trivia app and Clean Architecture from the excellent Flutter TDD Clean Architecture Course, I will not repeat here.

You can find out details of code metrics from the README of the link above.Enhancements made from the original codes:Dependencies updated to the latest version and null safety support.Replaced data_connection_checker package to connectivity_plus as it doesn\u2019t support null safety.Added freezed package to generate toString/toJson/fromJson, hence model class is not needed.flutter_clean_architectureGithub repo: https://github.com/limcheekin/fluwix/tree/number_trivia_flutter_clean_architecture/number_triviaTotal LOC for functional codes is 641 and test codes is 444. You can find out details of code metrics from the README of the link above. The test codes of flutter_clean_architecture has lesser LOC is due to there\u2019s no test cases for controller or presenter class where flutter_bloc has bloc tests. I raised a question How do I write test for the controller or presenter class? to the official github repo. In my opinion, we still can write Widget tests to cover the testing of this functionality.The flutter_clean_architecture package using view, controller and presenter classes compare to flutter_bloc package using event, bloc and state classes.ConclusionSo, which one is good for your team? Some developers will say \u201cLearn X, and forget the rest.\u201d I tend to disagreed as every team\u2019s experience, expertise and background is different, I think it is better for your team to look into options available and pick the one that fit well with your team. Lastly, I will go for flutter_clean_architecture package as it\u2019s codes look more natural to me. By the way, you can further enhance the codes by using injectable package if you don\u2019t want to write the code in dependencies.dart file manually.Hope this help and I\u2019d love to hear from you! :)Originally published at http://limcheekin.blogspot.com/2021/06/flutter-app-architecture-flutterbloc-or.html."}, "platform": "medium", "author_id": "d386951d-b942-46a1-8bfd-6220e47254cd", "author_full_name": "Nik Nik", "link": "https://medium.com/@limcheekin/flutter-app-architecture-flutter-bloc-or-flutter-clean-architecture-f0c154edce7d", "_id": "b4de5d02-86a0-48f5-8d4b-3ce18fc44296"}, {"content": {"Title": "Free Code Audit For Flutter Project", "Subtitle": null, "Content": "Jun 5, 2021\nWhen you see the title you must think that this is a click bait, otherwise it is too good to be true, right?

These four stages is defined by Emmanuel Ameisen in his recent book Building Machine Learning Powered Applications. As I think it is an important piece, I created a process diagram above and note down few important points for each stage. You can considered this is a study note.1. Identifying the Right ML ApproachThe best approach for a given problem (product goal) will depends on success criteria, data availability, task complexity and model choice.2. Building an Initial PrototypeStart by building an end-to-end prototype before working on a model which aim to tackle the product goal with no ML involved and will allow you to determine how to best apply ML.3. Iterating on ModelsIf you need ML, start gathering dataset, train a model and evaluate it shortcomings. The goal of this stage is to repeatedly alternate between error analysis and implementation.4. Deployment & MonitoringOnce a model shows good performance, you should pick an adequate deployment option. Once deployed, models often fail in unexpected ways. The last two chapters of the book will cover methods to mitigate and monitor model errors.Side NoteI added an arrow labelled \u201cNew product goal, Revised product goal\u201d to the process diagram. Based on my experience, software products evolve, it will not end there after the ML solution went live. Hence, it is likely that the existing product goal will be revised or new product goal being inspired or discovered.

First, I come across an article shared about Flutter Navigation 2.0. In my opinion, it is too complex, we need better abstraction to make it usable to developers. I search again and finally nailed down to two alternatives: flutter_modular and stacked.Let\u2019s look at simple code metrics (line of codes) for both packages:It is obvious that flutter_modular is the winner here. It has less boilerplate code and code generation is not required. For stacked, it still has more line of codes compared to flutter_modular after excluding the generated app.router.dart and app.locator.dart. Also, flutter_modular using Navigation 2.0 and stacked still using Navigation 1.0 if I\u2019m not wrong (Correct me if I\u2019m wrong).Lastly, there\u2019s one pending issue for Flutter Widgets Explorer to adopt flutter_modular as it\u2019s navigation library, the default back button is missing, I opened an issue that still pending for response at the time of writing.If you interested to dig into the code, feel free to look into the github repo for flutter_modular and stacked implementation.Happy coding! :)"}, "platform": "medium", "author_id": "d386951d-b942-46a1-8bfd-6220e47254cd", "author_full_name": "Nik Nik", "link": "https://medium.com/@limcheekin/flutter-navigation-flutter-modular-or-stacked-9fdf39412703", "_id": "b53e0ad8-825c-4e42-aa02-1d8f67435358"}, {"content": {"Title": "Deploy Serverless Machine Learning Models to AWS Lambda", "Subtitle": null, "Content": "Mar 24, 20211\nOriginally published at http://limcheekin.blogspot.com/2021/03/deploy-serverless-machine-learning.html.\nDeploy scikit-learn, spaCy and Keras models to AWSI just completed the Udemy course with the same title of the blog post.The course cover three machine learning examples using different library:scikit-learn: Using regression model from scikit-learn trained on California housing dataset for house price prediction.spacy: Using a small English model from spaCy NLP framework for named entity recognition.keras: Using ResNet50 computer vision deep learning model from Keras framework to create for image recognition.Let\u2019s me tell you the following value-added changes of my code from the original source code from the course:The examples are using Python 3.8 instead of Python 3.6 in the course and latest version of libraries except the scikit-learn example using earlier version of scikit-learn to align with m2cgen which has the possibility to convert scikit-learn model to native code and C code running in the microcontroller with emlearn.To deploy all examples. you only need git, no other installations are required. All examples are setup with continuous deployment pipeline using Github Actions.

Thanks for inspiration from an article A Flutter BLoC + Clean Architecture journey to release the #1st Idean Flutter app published on Medium.com. It mentioned about \u201cDart modules\u201d, I not sure whether we are referring to the same thing here.After gone through the article above, I perform a google search for Flutter module and I found many articles and videos on how to create modular Flutter project, or how to structure Flutter code in modular way, and a library known as flutter_modular. But I\u2019m looking for \u201creal\u201d modules that supported by Flutter and IDEs to define a physical boundary among modules, not a logical one defined by developers. It is an \u201caha!\u201d moment, out of no way I am thinking of typing flutter create -help command in my terminal window. From the list of options, I found the following option like what I am looking for.Then, I proceed to flutter.dev website to find out more information about the -t option, not much information found besides a description similar to the above. Hence, I decided to create a Flutter project to test it out. In the flutter project directory, I\u2019m creating two modules such as nested_list and tab_buttons using the following command:flutter create -t module <module_name>The following is directory structure of the Flutter project, you can see that the nested_list and tab_buttons module is outside the lib directory (All Flutter code need to be located in the lib directory normally).The following is the advantages of the \u201creal\u201d Flutter module besides modular structure:It has it\u2019s own pubspec.yaml file, you can manage assets, dependencies and other stuff on module-basis.It can have it main.dart, you can run the code of a module independent from project and other modules.It can have it own test directory, you can write tests to test code of the module.A Flutter project can have mix of non-null safety and null safety packages which segregated by modules.You can start null safety migration module by module without blocking the release cycle. Flutter Widgets Explorer will adopt this approach.Once the module is ready, you can link the module to the project by specify the following dependencies configuration in the pubspec.yaml file:The Flutter project is working in my mobile phone and Google Chrome with the following command:flutter run -d chromePlease check out the following github repo and test it out yourself:https://github.com/limcheekin/flutter-modules\nThanks for reading, I hope the write ups is helpful to you, hear from you soon! :)"}, "platform": "medium", "author_id": "d386951d-b942-46a1-8bfd-6220e47254cd", "author_full_name": "Nik Nik", "link": "https://medium.com/@limcheekin/flutter-multi-modules-support-57e9acd21c7a", "_id": "dd556839-2a12-4421-a194-4ae509cf6575"}, {"content": {"Title": "Your First Flutter App: The Flutter Widgets Explorer", "Subtitle": null, "Content": "Jan 4, 2021\nHappy new year 2021!If you found a third party widget which seems good fit to your application, I think the first thing you do is create a dedicated flutter application to test out the widget and get yourself familiar with the widget before integrate it to your existing application, right?

Start from now the mobile apps and the web app under one brand name.I think the experience of manage the re-branding process is worth sharing here besides the announcement. First of all, if you change the applicationId of the android app, you\u2019re actually publish a new app instead of update the existing one in the Google Play Store. Hence, you need a proper way to phase out the existing app and inform user the new app. I\u2019m adopted the following process:1. Making all the necessary changes for app re-branding and publish the new app to Google Play Store.2. Once the new app is ready to be installed by users, update the existing app to inform users to install the new app. I\u2019m using alert dialog, please refer to the following screen:3. After user click the \u201cInstall Now\u201d button, it will bring the user to the Google Play Store screen to install the app.Please let\u2019s me know if you have better way to manage the re-branding process.Thanks for your patient and reading till here.
